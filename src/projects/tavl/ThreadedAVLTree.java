/**<p> {@link ThreadedAVLTree} implements threaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree">Adelson-Velsky-Landis (AVL) trees</a>
 * (shorthand: TAVL trees). These trees:</p>
 * <ol>
 *      <li> Allow for efficient lookup, insertion and deletion in <em>O(logn)</em> time, by virtue
 *       of being AVL trees.</li>
 *       <li>Perform a full inorder traversal in <em>O(n)</em> time, by virtue of being threaded trees.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>Hence, two powerful ideas that we have talked about in lecture will now be combined in one data structure. </p>
 *
 *  <p>To get more than 50&#37; credit for this project, you <b>must</b> attempt to implement your tree as a <b>threaded</b>
 * tree, as discussed in lecture. We have access to your source code after submission and we <b>will</b> be checking to
 * make sure that you have been appropriately updating the tree's threads every time you must! You are also required to
 * implement a method for generating the inorder traversal over such a tree, and this method needs to be functioning
 * <b>entirely stacklesssly!</b>Read the project description for more in-depth information.</p>
 *
 * <p>Finally, for this project, <b>we assume that there are no duplicate keys in your data structure. </b> This means that, in our unit tests,
 * whenever we delete a key from your tree, <b>we expect it to no longer be found in the tree.</b> You may deal with this
 * invariant in any way you please, e.g. throw an exception if a duplicate is inserted, or delete all instances of a key when we ask for a deletion.</p>
