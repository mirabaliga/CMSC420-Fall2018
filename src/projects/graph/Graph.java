/**
 * <p>{@link Graph} is an abstraction over directed and weighted graphs. It supports insertion of nodes, insertion
 * and removal of edges, queries of connectedness, simple accessors, as well as shortest path computation. </p>
 *
 * <p>Nodes in {@link Graph} are simplistic in that they are characterized just by an increasing index. So, the first node
 * inserted would be considered node 0 (zero), the second one node 1 and so on and so forth. For this reason, removal
 * of <b>nodes</b> from a {@link Graph} instance is <b>not</b> supported, otherwise inconsistencies with the internal
 * representation of the instance could occur. For example, if we have 8 nodes and we remove the first one inserted,
 * should we consider a new node to have index 9 or 8? It's unclear, so we just let go of the requirement. </p>
